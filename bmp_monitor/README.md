# bmp\_monitor

Monitors a bitmap image for changes and displays them.  When the next image is detected to exist, it is loaded automatically.

Usage: ./bmp\_monitor <file-prefix>

Example: If the Bitmaps generated are located in /home/admin and will be generated with names frame1.bmp, frame2.bmp, frame3.bmp, and so on, then the proper way to run the program is:

./bmp\_monitor /home/admin/frame
